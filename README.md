 Welcome to the Pokedex Project!

This project aims to create a digital encyclopedia of all the Pokemon species, which will allow users to access detailed information about each creature, including their type, abilities, moves, and more. The project will utilize data from the official Pokemon API to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

The Pokedex will be developed using Java, and will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Users will be able to search for Pokemon ID number, and view detailed information about each species, including their stats, and more.

This project will also include a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a visually appealing and engaging experience for users. The GUI will allow users to browse through the Pokedex in a more interactive way.

Overall, the Pokedex Project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for Pokemon fans and enthusiasts, allowing them to learn more about their favorite creatures and explore the vast world of Pokemon.
